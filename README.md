# RomeroCookies
A database of quotes from the king of the dead - the late great George 
A. Romero for the Unix fortune cookie.

This database contains quotes from the trilogy of the dead movies (Night, 
Dawn, Day). Personally I think it all kind of went downhill from 'Day' 
so sorry! - I won't be including quotes from the subsequent movies. 

Usage
$ make
$ fortune [OPTIONS] romero


If you're a really cool kid, you'll add this to the end of your bashrc so you
can start every shell session with:

fortune /path/to/romero

Stay scared!
