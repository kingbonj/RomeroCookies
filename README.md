# RomeroCookies
A database of quotes from the Godfather of zombies - the late great 
**George A. Romero** - for the Unix fortune cookie.

This database contains many lines of dialogue from his trilogy of 
the dead movies with a few personal quotes thrown in for a laugh:

1. Night of the Living Dead (1968)
2. Dawn of the Dead (1978)
3. Day of the Dead (1985)
4. George A. Romero
 
I haven't included quotes from the subsequent movies (Land, Diary, Survival)
because ~~they arent as good~~ I have not had time, BUT if somebody would 
like to contribute these to the database that would be fantastic for fans of 
the movies.

## Files

- romero - *contains the fortunes*
- romero.dat - *an index file, suitable for use with the Python fortune program*
- Makefile - *a file for unix systems to build the database*

## Usage
```
$ make
$ fortune [OPTIONS] romero
```

If you want to bring your terminal back from the dead, you'll add this 
to the end of your bashrc so you can start every shell session with a
touch of nihilistic wisdom:
```
fortune /path/to/romero
```

## Examples
```
"They're coming for you, Barbara!"
                        -- Johnny - Night of the Living Dead (1968)
                        
"When there is no more room in Hell, the dead will walk the Earth."
                                 -- Peter - Dawn of the Dead (1978)

"A-... a-... alloooooleeeeesha!"
                                    -- Bub - Day of the Dead (1985)                                                       
```

## Warning

Some of the quotes are explicit, I have not edited them from the 
original texts and there may be profanity. All rights belong to 
the relevant copyright holders, this is simply a bit of fun.
